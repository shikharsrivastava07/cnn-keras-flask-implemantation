# cnn-keras-flask-implemantation
This project is an initial work of Predicting using CNN. The predictions can be still improved as I have not re-trained the ResNet50 model.
Implementation is done in Keras and an API was created using Flask to be used in a sample web-app to use the model.

## Execution of the app
To run the application, simply clone the repo and run:
```
python app.py
```

Now click on `Upload` button and upload any image you want to predict.

Clicking on the `Submit` button should provide you with the predicted output.
